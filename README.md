# Project 01
This is a Java implementation for sorting algorithms.
1. Insertion sort
2. Merge sort
3. Heap sort
4. In-place Quick sort
5. Median-of-three Quick sort

# How to run:
1. You need to run the Main.java class. It contains the main() method.
2. The results will be displayed for randomly generated number arrays.
3. For generating results for sorted random number arrays, uncomment 'sortArrayAscending(arrNum1, arrNum2, arrNum3);' in the main() method before running the code.
4. For generating results for reversely sorted random number arrays, uncomment 'sortArrayDscending(arrNum1, arrNum2, arrNum3);' in the main() method before running the code.
